# Cross-compilation assets

These are cross-compiling assets for ROS2.
Documentation is in the wiki: https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Cross-compilation



This version is intended to cross-build a lightweight (barebone) ROS2 for devices implementing the ARMv7 architecture




## TODO

 - [ ] Customize current files for armv7 architecture
 - [ ] Discard the unnecessary packages for a barebone ROS2
 - [ ] Automate for cross-building custom packages
